"""
This module implements the :class:`Circuit` object which is in charge of
maintaining the tree hierarchy for the circuit. This includes handling all
the gates in the circuit as well as keeping track of global parameters (for
instance R in FreeXOR). It also parses the .circuit file into the tree via the
function :meth:`gabes.circuit.build_tree`.

At the moment, the structure of the .circuit file must be like the one
shown in examples; that is, each child gate of a gate (except the root)
must be surrounded by parenthesis.
